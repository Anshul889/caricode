            At Caricode we offer multi-device support for your website. Users
            are increasingly accessing the web through their mobile, however
            most of the web isnâ€™t optimized for mobile devices. Mobile devices
            are often constrained by display size and require a different
            approach to how content is laid out on the screen.

            At CariCode we develop your website so it can be accessed seamlessly
            across different devices: phones, qphablets, tablets, laptops,
            desktops, and more. Screen sizes are always changing, so its
            important to us that your site can adapt to any screen size, today
            or in the future.

            All our web applications are built using Responsive web design.
            Originally defined by Ethan Marcotte in A List Apart, Responsive web
            design responds to the needs of the users and the devices theyre
            using. The layout changes based on the size and capabilities of the
            device. For example, on a phone users would see content shown in a
            single column view; a tablet might show the same content in two
            columns.
          </p>
          <p>
            We ensure your website is optimised across all devices. Our
            responsive designs work behind-the-scenes to give a user a seamless
            experience no matter what device they choose.
